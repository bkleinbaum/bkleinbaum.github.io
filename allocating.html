		Ben worked with a New York City political campaign to help plan its GOTV operation. The campaign sought to undertake a massive GOTV effort with more than 30 field offices across all 5 boroughs. Ben worked closely with the GOTV directors, regional field directors, and others to create turfs for all the field offices broken down by election district. Each had to match the potential volunteer base as well a realistic target universe that the volunteers could reach.
